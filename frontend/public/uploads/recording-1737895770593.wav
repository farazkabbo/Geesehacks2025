Let's learn how to create an immersive and informative experience using Slides as your virtual background in your next Zoom meeting or webinar. From the main toolbar, click Share Screen. Next choose Advanced, then Slides as Virtual Background, and Share. You'll be able to choose from any file created in Keynote or Microsoft PowerPoint. Let it load for a moment, and here we are. Today in Denver, we're expecting a high of 50. Just kidding, you know I couldn't resist, it's a pretty cool feature. Here we are, overlaid on top of the slide. You can control them using the arrows right here on screen, and you can even click and drag to resize or reposition your video. Perfect. You'll be able to access some of your typical video settings while in this mode. For example, you can still use Touch Up My Appearance, Adjust for Low Light, just know that you won't be able to change your background until you're out of this mode. Click the ellipsis within the slide control to see options to return to that resize, or just click and drag anytime. You can also split your video off entirely from the slides. Now this looks a lot like a typical Zoom virtual background, and of course you can easily reverse it using the same menu. Well, I hope you've enjoyed this quick demo, and I will see you next time in the Zoom Learning Center.
