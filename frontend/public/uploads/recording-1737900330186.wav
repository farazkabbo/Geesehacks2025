Water, water. What is water? What is water for you? Water? To me, as a chemist, water is a truly fascinating molecule. It is a fascinating molecule. It has so many interesting properties and it's so important. So important. For me, it's fun. You can swim there, you can do surfing, you can just jump to it from some rock. It's always fun with the water. I enjoy being in the water, being on the surfboard and feeling the waves going under me. It's a really relaxing feeling. Whenever we travel, we always try to be in a place that has a lot of water, that is close to water. Water is so important for every single human being on this planet. It should be clean. It should be safe. Half of which we'll use just once and then throw away. By 2050, when the population explodes to almost 10 billion people, it's expected that plastic production will triple. The problem with that is, is that today only a fraction of the plastic that we produce is recycled. The rest ends up in our environment. It's an incredible substance designed for the economy. It is the worst substance possible for the environment. Worldwide, we're dumping the equivalent of one rubbish truck of trash into the water every minute. By 2050, the plastic in the sea could weigh more than all the fish. The worst thing about plastic as soon as it hits the environment is that it fragments. It never stops being plastic. The plastic it breaks down smaller and smaller and smaller. This is one of the reasons why we started with MJ Aquaholics. It's a project about spreading the awareness about the plastic pollution of water. We are cleaning beaches, we are cleaning whenever we go on holidays, on some long weekend. We want to travel all these places with water and check how polluted they are. The problem is really, really big and there is a lot of trash everywhere. We want to encourage people to do also the same. We want to share this information because not all people pay attention to it. I just wish to people to care about what they do, what they do with their trash. Every little thing counts. Every single piece of trash you pick up, it counts. Every single step towards being more sustainable, it counts. It even counts if you think about how much plastic you use. Just please care about our planet.
